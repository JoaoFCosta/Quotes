# Quotes: A Swift Experiment

Quotes is a Mac Menu Bar App built with Swift
which uses the [Forismatic API](http://forismatic.com/en/api/) to present you
with inspiring quotes.  If you don't like reading you can even make your
computer read them to you!

build menu bar apps and how to use the some parts of the Cocoa Framework.
