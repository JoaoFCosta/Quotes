# Quotes: A Swift Experiment
---
Quotes is a Mac Menu Bar App built with Swift
which uses the [Forismatic API](http://forismatic.com/en/api/) to present you
with inspiring quotes.  If you don't like reading you can even make your
computer read them to you!

This is just a personal project that enabled me to learn how to use Swift to
build menu bar apps and how to use the some parts of the Cocoa Framework. üëç
